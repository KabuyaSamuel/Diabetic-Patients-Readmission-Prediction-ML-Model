# Diabetic Patient Readmission Prediction Project


# Description

Your final project will involve all topics covered from week 2 to 8 by using data to solve a real-life problem. Remember you're doing this with your team.

You’ve learned a ton about data collection and cleaning, visualization and insight, machine leearning, and model evaluation in this course. The final project is your chance to solve a problem with these from scratch.


## Project and Design Guidelines




## How should you work?

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using [Google docs](https://docs.google.com) or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work you’ve done, and what work is left to do.

### ✨✨Have fun!✨✨
